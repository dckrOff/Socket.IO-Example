> ### Note:
> - I haven't implemented any Push Service that can awake this App from the Background and show the Notification.
> - If you know Node.js and FCM you can implement by your own here's the [guide](https://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Sending_Firebase_Cloud_Messages_from_a_Node.js_Server) and can use this [Node Module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fcm-node)
> - In this App you can add as many functionalities you want like Storing of messages in the mobile local DB(SQLite) and also make it more specific so that only one person can chat with other.
